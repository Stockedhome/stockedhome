# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],
version 2.1, available at
[https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html][v2.1].

Some adjustments from the original Covenant have been made. The most notable are:
* Future-tempering the *Our Pledge* section
* Adding additional clarification to the *Scope* section
* Adding instructions for reporting my (BellCube's) behavior to
  the *Enforcement* section
* Making minor yet important changes to the *Enforcement Guidelines* section

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of any attribute
not directly relevant to their participation. Such irrelevant factors that have been
discriminated against by society in the past and present include (but are sadly not
limited to) a participant's age, body size, visible or invisible disability,
ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste,
color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. An act of participation shall
be judged and considered on its own merits. The participant shall not be considered
when judging an act of participation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include—but are not limited to–using an
official email address, posting via an official social media account, acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event, or otherwise taking
action that may be considered representative of the project and its participants.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[stockedhome@bellcube.dev][mailto:stockedhome@bellcube.dev]. All complaints
will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. If the complaint regards
myself (BellCube), it is especially important to carefully explain why you feel
the action or group of actions I've taken violates this Code of Conduct. I'm a
stubborn cube sometimes.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident. Publicizing a report discourages honest, caring reports.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Private Informal Warning/Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate.

In some situations, a public apology may be requested. Nuance must be used
when invoking this as it most often comes off as a form of shaming and not
actually further the remedying of the incident. Shaming breeds resentment and
should be avoided. A public apology should only be requested only if it would
improve the situation without simultaneously worsening it.

### 2. Private Formal Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions. More serious than would constitute an informal warning/correction.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued or excessively problematic
behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including
unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, will be allowed.
